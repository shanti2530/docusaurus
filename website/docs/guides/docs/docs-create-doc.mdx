By default, `slug` is appended to the doc plugin's `routeBasePath`, which is `/docs`. For example, the above sets the URL to `/docs/bonjour`.

See [Docs-only mode](docs-introduction.mdx#docs-only-mode) to remove the `/docs` part from the URL.

:::note
You can use:

- Absolute slugs: `slug: /mySlug`, `slug: /` (starts from the site root)
- Relative slugs: `slug: mySlug`, `slug: ./../mySlug` (relative to the current path)
:::

For example, without a slug:

- File: `docs/guide/hello.md` → URL: `/docs/guide/hello`

With a slug:

- File: `docs/guide/hello.md` and `slug: /bonjour` → URL: `/docs/bonjour`

:::tip
If you rename or move a document, its default URL will change. To keep URLs stable, set an explicit `slug` in the front matter.
:::

If you want a document to be available at the root, such as `https://docusaurus.io/docs/`, use:

```md
---
id: my-home-doc
slug: /
---

Lorem ipsum
